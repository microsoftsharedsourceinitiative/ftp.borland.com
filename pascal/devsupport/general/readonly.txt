Some notes on the readonly style, appropos nothing....

ReadOnly in an Edit control only works if the .EXE file is marked 
as 3.1 only - blame Microsoft.   Or use this...  (I think we're 
considering making this a linker option.

program Mark31;  
{ utility to mark a Windows EXE as requiring 3.1 or above }

const
  Offset = $13E;
  NewVersion: Word = $30A;

var
  F: File;

begin
  if ParamCount <> 1 then Halt(1);
  Assign(F, ParamStr(1));
  Reset(F, 1);
  if IOResult <> 0 then
  begin
    Writeln('Error: Unable to open ', ParamStr(1));
    Halt(1);
  end;
  Seek(F, Offset);
  BlockWrite(F, NewVersion, SizeOf(NewVersion));
  Close(F); 
end.



If you send a wm_ReadOnly message to the edit control, 
it will be made read only regardless of your exe flags.
