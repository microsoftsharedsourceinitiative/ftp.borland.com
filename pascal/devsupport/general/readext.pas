  This program example can replace the ReadKey Function and can
  be used in the same way.  However it does require an AT extended
  keyboard and might be unpredictable if used with a non extended
  keyboard.  This code also requires that you define a global variable
  called ScanCode of type char.  This is important in determining
  whether the key is a standard or extended type.
